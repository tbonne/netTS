\title{Extract one network within time constriants}
\usage{
net.window.para(data, windowstart, windowend, directed = FALSE,
  effortFun = NULL, effortData = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe with relational data in the first two columns, with weights in the thrid columns, and a time stamp in the fourth row. Note: time stamps should be in ymd or ymd_hms format. The lubridate package can be very helpful in organizing times.}

\item{windowstart}{The start of the window.}

\item{windowend}{The end of the window.}

\item{directed}{Whether to consider the network as weighted. (default=FALSE)}

\item{effortFun}{This is a function that takes as input the data within a window of time and returns the total sampling effort.}

\item{effortData}{This is a dataframe containing the data used to calculate sampling effort. The first column should contain timedate values.}
}
\description{
This function will generate one network from a dataframe with time constraints.
