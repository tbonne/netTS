\title{Extract networks from a moving window}
\usage{
extract_networks(data, windowsize, windowshift, directed = FALSE,
  trim = FALSE, SRI = FALSE, effortFun = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe with relational data in the first two rows, with weights in the thrid row, and a time stamp in the fourth row. Note: time stamps should be in ymd or ymd_hms format. The lubridate package can be very helpful in organizing times.}

\item{windowsize}{The size of each window in which to generate a network.}

\item{windowshift}{The amount of time to shift the window when generating networks.}

\item{directed}{Whether to consider the network as directed or not (TRUE/FALSE).}

\item{trim}{Whether to remove nodes from the network if they are past the last observation time.}
}
\description{
This function will create a time series of networks from a dataframe with relational events and a time stamp.
